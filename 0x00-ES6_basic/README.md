ES6 Basics
ECMAScript 2015, also known as ES6 is the sixth major version of the ECMASript language specification. ECMAScript is the standard for scripting languages, and javascript is an implementaion of the new standard.

New features in ES6
The let keyword: allows you to declare variables that are limited to the block they are define in

The const keyword: used for defining constants whose values cannoot be reassigned

 Arrow function: provide a concise syntax for writing function expressions. They have a shorter syntax, lexcal 'this' binding, and do not create their own 'this' context

Classes : Es6 introduced class syntax, which is syntactical sugar over the protoype-based inheritance model of javascript. Classes provide a more familar syntax for defining objects and their behaviours
