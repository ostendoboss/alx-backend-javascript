ES6 Promises
ES6 Promises are a feature introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. Promises provide a way to deal with asynchronous code in a more structured and readable manner, avoiding the so-called "callback hell." They simplify the process of working with asynchronous operations by allowing developers to chain and handle the results or errors of those operations.

Basic Usage
To create a new Promise, you use the Promise constructor, which takes a function with two parameters: resolve and reject. Here's an example:

javascript const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { // Asynchronous operation setTimeout(() => { const data = "Hello, world!"; resolve(data); // Success case // reject(new Error("Something went wrong!")); // Error case }, 2000); });
